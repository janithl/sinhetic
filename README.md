# Sinhetic 1.0

Sinhetic is a transliterator app to convert Latin script phonetic Sinhala to Unicode Sinhala. It
is based on the [UCSC Real Time Unicode Converter](http://www.ucsc.cmb.ac.lk/ltrl/services/feconverter/t1.html) 
and uses the [Sinhala Spell Dictionary for OpenOffice.org 3.0](https://github.com/laknath/Sinhala-Dictionary) by 
[Buddhika Laknath](https://github.com/laknath) for dictionary lookup.

Version: 1.0 - Released: 20 April, 2014

## Requirements

Sorry, but you need to have Sinhala installed on your phone for this app to work. I tried 
unsuccessfully to create a workaround using web fonts, but to no avail.

iOS devices already have Sinhala. If you're on Android, [Malinthe](https://twitter.com/malinthe) 
has [a great guide](http://blog.malinthe.com/2014/04/how-to-get-perfect-sinhala-text-on-android-4-4-kitkat/).

## Demo

~~I have a rather shady demo running off my Dropbox~~

The demo is at [janithl.github.io/sinhetic/](http://janithl.github.io/sinhetic/).


## Google Play

The code has been wrapped in a simple Cordova app and put on Google Play 
as a [free Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.yamu.sinhetic).
