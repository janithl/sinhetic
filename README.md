# Sinhetic 1.0

Sinhetic is a transliterator app to convert Latin script phonetic Sinhala to Unicode Sinhala. It
is based on the [UCSC Real Time Unicode Converter](http://www.ucsc.cmb.ac.lk/ltrl/services/feconverter/t1.html) 
and uses the [Sinhala Spell Dictionary for OpenOffice.org 3.0](https://github.com/laknath/Sinhala-Dictionary) by 
[Buddhika Laknath](https://github.com/laknath) for dictionary lookup.

Version: 1.0 - Released: 20 April, 2014

## Demo

I have a rather [shady demo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/tvqzqstlvp67ngs/sinhetic.html) running off 
my Dropbox. I hope to release this as a Cordova app on the Play Store soon.
